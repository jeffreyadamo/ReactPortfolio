      My interest in learning how to code comes from wanting to broaden my
      understanding of how data is stored. I'm a biochemist research scientist
      and spend a lot of time figuring out how things work. I've learned that I
      acquire a ton of data and have never really had any direction on how to
      organize it.
      <br />
      <br />
      Recently, I worked on a project with a consultant to develop a LIMS
      (Laboratory Information Management System) data server and that experience
      of converting/migrating all the raw data to a database forced me to learn
      some jargon (booleans, string, logics) on a very, very basic level. It
      taught me how to communicate what scientists want with what the design
      team needs. It was a challenge that left me realizing how little I know
      (having never taken a computer science course), and was an encouragement
      in seeing how much my thought process might align with that universe if I
      learned it.
      <br />
      <br />
      I've enjoyed being thrown into the coding deep end with this bootcamp
      because other, self-taught methods of learning how to code through Python
      and SQL books haven't been quite effective in keeping my attention. This
      is a challenge and I'm excited to finangle my way through it!
