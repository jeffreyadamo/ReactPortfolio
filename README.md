## Objective

Here's a showcase of my web development portfolio with projects and homework assignments completed while enrolled in **UW's Full Stack Web Developemnt boot camp**. This is the *third* iteration of portfolios during this course. This version features **ReactJS** design and was initiated in week 20. The previous version was in week 8 using Materialize CSS framework, JavaScript and JQuery. A simple portfolio was also created in week 2 where HTML and CSS were the only languages introduced. 

This portfolio features updates to the following:
* [Porfolio](#)
