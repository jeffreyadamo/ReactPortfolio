## Objective

This is the *third* iteration of portfolios during this course. This version features **React** design and was initiated in week 20.

## Issues/Future Development:

<!-- ### I would like to see a message form in contact.html, but currently do not know how to hook it up. I've designed the front end to match the styling used, but do not yet know how to implement this. A seperate branch has been made named "contactMessage" that had the placeholder code for this design. -->
